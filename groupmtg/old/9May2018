fixed datatype error in dat file
scaled up data to get an actual FFT from presto (YAY)

Chi square prefiltering
	Take only nonzero flux points
	Include errors? Convert error (mag) into error (flux)
	Calculate reduced chi squared to a 0th order polynomial fit
		IF ~1, then should be non-variable



EIKE NOTES:

Don't fit to horizontal line -- fit to 1st order polynomial

Finish out the FFT process on one star before messing with the chi square!
