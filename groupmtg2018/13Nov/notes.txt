My updates:
    Grad school applications
    Summer research follow-up VLA proposal was approved
    Prepared time series data for FFT-ing (rebinned), next step is to FFT all
        the stars and check out which kinds of signals are common, which stand
        out, etc.


Notes:

To characterize 'noise' in maxi j according to a set of reference stars...
    Calculate average of reference star fluxes for each time point
    Subtract average reference star from all MAXI J points. This 
        removes the clouds, etc, from the maxi observations
    Subtract average reference star from TYCHO star. Same as above.
    Now we have MAXI and TYCHO, with variation in throughput from the night 
        subtracted off.
    To look for variability, we want to confirm that Tycho is not variable
    and MAXI is. 
    
    Leave stuff in instrumental magnitudes. mag = 2.5log(ADU).
    
    Now what is sigma squared?
        sigma^2 = SUM(TYCHO(t) - AVG(TYCHO(all times))^2/N)
        where N is the number of time points.
        This is sigma for a non-variable star.

    Now, chi^2 for maxi is (1/(sigma^2))*SUM(MAXI(t) - AVG(MAXI(all times))^2)    

    chi^2_nu should equal 1 for non-variability.

    Then, 'probability confidence interval'.
