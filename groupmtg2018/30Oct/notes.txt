Lab Report
Visiting Harvard CfA Thursday - Sunday

Ask Paul and Desika and Laura. 

Have light curves, can FFT -- next, FFT all of them and see what signals are common, i.e., which might be real/fake?

Fold pulse profiles using PRESTO

Atmospheric dispersion:
    Prism effect towards the horizon
    If you look at images very closely, and at high resolution, you see blue light and red light in separate locations
    Red light gets bent less than the blue light

    Parallactic angle - shortest angular distance to the horizon
        Amplitude of dispersion depends on distance from zenith
        The effect is minimal for seeing-limited observations
            Especially in infrared

    AO system usually takes care of this
    Mostly care about it in optical
        V band atmo dispersion is about 0.2 arcsec (usually less than seeing)
        
    If you set up the slit (for spectroscopy) to be aligned with the parallactic angle, all the light goes into the slit and it doesn't end up mattering. 
    
    But, what if you have a fiber spectrograph? Then you pretty much can't get both colors -- either blue or red. So what do you do?
        Use an ADC!

    ADC:
        Put a prism in your optical system. Blue light comes in, gets refracted. Red light comes in, goes out a different angle. 
        Add another identical prism underneath. Rotate the prisms with respect to each other (on same axis) to cancel out the parallactic angle and orient it correctly on the sky. With the right amplitude in the opposite direction, it cancels out the effect of AD.

    Commonly used on big telescopes where image quality is really good.
