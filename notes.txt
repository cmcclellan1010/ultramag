WORKFLOW:

1. Use chisq.py to load star files, split into bins, and calculate chi squared
 scalefactor for those bins. Output is 'scalefactors.p' and 'starbins.p' (file
 is very large!)
3. Use lightcurves.py to view the lightcurves with their new, accurate error 
bars and chi squared values 

Invidual Meeting Oct 5:
    Chi squared with new errorbars means something
    Sort by chi squared (new errorbars)
        Grab the most variable stars we have (in chi squared terms), look at 
        the light curves by eye

Group Meeting Oct 9:
    Fourier transform some of the interesting light curves
    Figure out what's happening to the chi squared -- they should peak at 1.

Group Meeting Oct 23:
    My talking points:
        Fixed chi squared scaling - I was multiplying the existing errorbars by
        the scale factor, but the right thing to do is multiply by the square
        root of the scale factor (since chisq nu equation has uncertainty sq
        in denominator)
        
        Now, histogram peaks at 1 as expected, with a couple notable stars up
        in the tens and even hundreds range, indicating variability.
        
        [look at FFTs of interesting light curves]
