WORKFLOW:

1. Use chisq.py to load star files, split into bins, and calculate chi squared
 scalefactor for those bins. Output is 'scalefactors.p' and 'starbins.p' (file
 is very large!)
3. Use lightcurves.py to view the lightcurves with their new, accurate error 
bars and chi squared values 

Invidual Meeting Oct 5:
    Chi squared with new errorbars means something
    Sort by chi squared (new errorbars)
        Grab the most variable stars we have (in chi squared terms), look at 
        the light curves by eye

Group Meeting Oct 9:
    Fourier transform some of the interesting light curves
    Figure out what's happening to the chi squared -- they should peak at 1.

Group Meeting Oct 23:
    My talking points:
        Fixed chi squared scaling - I was multiplying the existing errorbars by
        the scale factor, but the right thing to do is multiply by the square
        root of the scale factor (since chisq nu equation has uncertainty sq
        in denominator)
        
        Now, histogram peaks at 1 as expected, with a couple notable stars up
        in the tens and even hundreds range, indicating variability.
        
        [look at FFTs of interesting light curves]

    Notes:
        
Individual Meeting Nov 30
    make histogram of powers
    are there certain frequencies where that happens?
        See a lot of stuff, is that actual signal or not?

    Questions:
        Details of reading complex array
            Power is sqrt(x^2+y^2)?
            How to switch from time bins to frequency bins?
            Normalized power?
        
        "Histogram of powers"
            Does this mean just n vs. power? Basically a measure of how common
            it is to get a certain power (regardless of what frequency its at) 
            to get a better understanding of what our noise threshold should 
            be?

            FOR A GIVEN STAR
        
            OR

            For some frequency range, what does a histogram of powers at that 
            frequency look like? If power is high for all stars, that means 
            it's a common signal to measure.

Reading complex array - magnitude is A*A if A is your complex number
Our time resolution is 2 minutes, so the maximum frequency is 1/4min
    Resolution is 1/(total duration of time series)
    Start time, end time, data points in between

For a given star, power histogram with n on y axis and power on x axis

Individual Meeting Jan 25

Email Octavi with healpix number for our region, reply to Eikenberry's email [DONE]

Email Scott, show him what we're getting by reading in the complex arrays like he is
    Tell him it's not like what we see in presto, ask about why there's a difference
    Show him the complex number we get as the first power (this should be real)
    Powers are much larger than they should be, even though normalized

Answers from Scott
------------------

> First data point in the FFT is complex. Why?

That is due to the way that the DC and Nyquist values (both real) are packed into that first complex value. The real part is the DC value and the complext part is the Nyquist. This is a packing technique used by quite a few FFT codes, because it lets the FFT'd data be the same size as the input data.

> FFT doesn't look like it does in PRESTO

You might need to change to "raw" normalization for that. By default the powers are normalized via a running median.

        >> Does he mean change PRESTO or change our script?
            He's talking about PRESTO. 

> The powers are way too large.

See above about the normalization.


Things to do
------------

Change PRESTO settings to use raw normalization.

Steve out of town this weekend.





Individual Meeting Feb 1 2019
============================================

Our plots and PRESTO do match up (yay)

Email from Octavi -- pick out an interesting source (or two?)

Grad school responses



"Short term variability of evolved massive stars with TESS"
     - Find their dataset, send it through PRESTO
     - 2 min sampling rate
     - See if it looks like what they have in their paper, just examine the FFT in PRESTO
